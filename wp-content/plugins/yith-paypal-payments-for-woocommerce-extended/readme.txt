== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it compatible with all WordPress themes? =

Compatibility with all themes is impossible because they are too many, but generally if themes are developed according to WordPress and WooCommerce guidelines, YITH plugins are compatible with them. Yet, we can grant compatibility with themes developed by YITH, because they are constantly updated and tested with our plugins. Sometimes, especially when new versions are released, it might only require some time for them to be all updated, but you can be sure that they will be tested and will be working in a few days.

= How can I get support if my WooCommerce plugin is not working? =

If you have problems with our plugins or something is not working as it should, first follow these preliminary steps:

* Test the plugin with a WordPress default theme, to be sure that the error is not caused by the theme you are currently using.
* Deactivate all plugins you are using and check if the problem is still occurring.
* Ensure that your plugin version, your theme version, and your WordPress and WooCommerce version (if required) are updated and that the problem you are experiencing has not already been solved in a later plugin update.
* If none of the previous listed actions helps you solve the problem, then, submit a ticket in the forum and describe your problem accurately, specify WordPress and WooCommerce versions you are using, and any other information that might help us solve your problem as quickly as possible. Thanks!

= My onboarding fails and shows an error, is the plugin not working? =

Not all countries have access to the PayPal Commerce Platform and even if your account is based in the US, UK, France Spain, or Italy, you could experience connection issues. Please contact PayPal support or sales to check the eligibility of your account.

= What is a Sandbox PayPal account? =

A Sandbox account is a special setup to test your payment and integration with PayPal on a website. You can make payments and test orders without exchanging money. This is great if your site is a staging environment. Don’t forget to change to live payments, once you have finished testing the integration. For more information check PayPal Sandbox documentation.

= Is the YITH PayPal Payment for WooCommerce Plugin PCI compliant? =

Yes, the plugin is PCI compliant. No card details are saved on your WooCommerce website, but instead are stored on the PayPal Commerce Platform. There is a two-way connection between your website and the PayPal Commerce Platform to update the payment status or add the delivery address details if a customer chooses to checkout from the product page, for example.

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a standard mandated by the card schemes to increase controls on cardholder data to reduce the risk of fraud. It applies to small businesses as well as larger service providers including PayPal. When using the YITH PayPal Payment for WooCommerce Plugin you use a method which is PCI compliant, but you would need to do a self-assessment to check if your business is too. More information can be found here: [https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/]( https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/ "Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ")
